Exploratory Data Analysis - Online Shopping in Retail

## A Description of the project
You currently work for a large retail company where you have the task to conduct exploratory data analysis on a dataset of online shopping website activity. 
With the increasing popularity of online shopping, this dataset provides valuable insights into consumer behaviour.
We will use various statistical and visualisation techniques to explore the data and draw meaningful insights. 
This analysis will not only provide a better understanding of customer behaviour but also help the business optimise marketing strategies and improve their customer experience.
The data contains information about the website activity of users over one year. 
Each sample represents the user interacting with the website during a shopping session.
Overall, this project will showcase the power of exploratory data analysis in uncovering valuable insights from large datasets and how to leveraged these insights to drive business success.
